As the Project 3 prompt stated, companies monitor their employee's activities through log files, which can be extraneously long to sift through just at the glance of an eye. The task at hand is being able to parse a log file in order to generate reports of various activities employees might be doing, such as reporting suspicious activities, irresponsible behavior, system glitches, domain counts, and many other reports. My approach to solving the problem of being able to parse through the log is to use data structures like dictionaries, sets, and lists to sort through the log file; These data structures are used to break down large pieces of information and format it any way the user wants it to be, and I believe that they would be useful in this assignment. In terms of functions, I will be using at least 4 functions, with a function to define each of the following activities: Suspicious activities, Irresponsible behavior, System glitches, and Domain Count.
