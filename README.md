## Week 2 Repository:

## Information Regarding Project:
### For this project, I need to be able to parse through the userlog.log file and be able to sort through the following insights: Suspicious Activities, Irresponsible Behavior, System Glitch, and Domain Count.

## Flow for Solving the Project:
### First, I created 4 different flowcharts, each flowchart describing the process of parsing through the insights. In these flowcharts, I defined each insight as a function and need to be able to test and successfully run each insight. Next, I will implement each insight into Jupyter as one notebook and put the project together.
